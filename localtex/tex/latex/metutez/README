For starting:
1. Edit preambl.tex with your information. Edit all text files with
   one of the UTF8 or ISO8859-9 (Latin 5) encoding. Use consistent
   encoding.
   provide the following:
  \title{...}
  \author{yourname}
  \degree{yourdegree}
  \department{your department}
  \date{Month Year}
  \graduateschool{...}
  \director{gradschooldirector}
  \headofdept{...}
  \supervisor{name}{affiliation}
  \turkishsupervisor{tr unvan isim}{bolum}
  \cosupervisor{name}{affiliation}
  \turkishcosupervisor{tr unvan isim}{bolum}
  \committeemember{i}{name}{affiliation}
  \committeemember{ii}{name}{affiliation}
  University}
  \committeemember{iii}{name}{affiliation}
  \committeemember{iv}{name}{affiliation}
  \shortdegree{Ph.D./M.Sc.}
  \keywords{...}
  \turkishtitle{...}
  \turkishdegree{Doktora/Yüksek Lisans}
  \turkishdepartment{Bolum}
  \turkishdate{Ay Yil}
  \anahtarklm{...}

  As the first ({i}) committee member, define head of the examining
  committee, it should be the first item in the signature list.
  You should define four members here. Style file will insert your
  supervisor as the second item in the signature list.

2. copy tez-ornek.tex as your starting document
3. edit it. choose the appropriate encoding in as one of:
   \usepackage[latin5]{inputenc}
   of
   \usepackage[utf8]{inputenc}

   in the second line.

4. Enter your abstract and oz information.
5. You can edit your whole document in a single file or choose
   to have each chapter in a separate document. Second one is
   more practical as the size of the document increases.
   \input{introduction}
   and
   \input{thatsallfolks}
   lines refer to two other files introduction.tex and thatsallfolks.tex
   maintain your own chapter files instead and for all chapters put
   an \input line in your main document
6. For graphics inclusion, use \inputgraphics{filename} if you give filename without
   extension, latex will search for an appropriate file in current directory. If you
   use latex; dvips to generate postscript you should have a .eps picture
   "filename.eps" in current directory. If you use pdflatex to generate pdf,
   you can have either of ".pdf" file (use epstopdf to convert eps files) or ".jpg"
   in current directory, pdf driver can process both.
7. For bibliography it is convenient to use a bibliography database in bib
   format. But all bibliography entries in tez-bib.bib (change the master document
   \usebibliography{tez-bib} line in order to change the filename). For building
   the bibliography follow this steps.
   latex (or pdflatex) your document once
   run "bibtex maindocument" once (not .bib file but .tex file)
   then latex/pdflatex your document twice.
   Repeat this steps when you change .bib file. Otherwise (adding citations in the main
   document) you don't have to run bibtex. Just latex/pdflatex.
8. for inserting a "List of abbreviations" and/or "list of symbols" use glossary
   environment (just before closing preliminaries section)
   \begin{glossary}
   ...you can typeset as you wish here...
   \end{glossary}
   this will appear as a chapter titled "LIST OF ABBREVIATIONS". If you use another word
   to be substituted for ABBREVIATIONS, give it as an optional parameter like:
   \begin{glossary}[SYMBOLS]
   \end{glossary}
9. The default is 1.5 spacing. If you want to switch spacing to single space temporarily,
   use singlespace environment
   \begin{singlespace}
   \end{singlespace}
